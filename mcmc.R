## This topic doesn't have much to do with nicer code, but there is
## probably some overlap in interest. However, some of the topics that
## we cover arise naturally here, so read on!  We'll flesh out
## sections that use interesting programming techniques (especially
## higher order functions) over time.

## # What is MCMC and when would you use it?

## MCMC is simply an algorithm for sampling from a distribution.
## 
## It's only one of many algorithms for doing so.  The term stands for
## "Markov Chain Monte Carlo", because it is a type of "Monte Carlo"
## (i.e., a random) method that uses "Markov chains" (we'll discuss
## these later).  MCMC is just one type of Monte Carlo method,
## although it is possible to view many other commonly used methods as
## simply special cases of MCMC.

## As the above paragraph shows, there is a bootstrapping problem with
## this topic, that we will slowly resolve.

## ## Why would I want to sample from a distribution?

## You may not realise you want to (and really, you may not actually
## want to).  However, sampling from a distribution turns out to be
## the easiest way of solving some problems.  In MCMC's use in
## statistics, sampling from a distribution is simply a means to an
## end.

## Probably the most common way that MCMC is used is to draw samples
## from the **posterior probability distribution** of some model in
## Bayesian inference.  With these samples, you can then ask things
## like "what is the mean and credibility interval for a parameter?".

## For example, suppose that you have fit a model where the posterior
## probability density is some function $f$ of parameters $(x, y)$.
## Then, to compute the mean value of parameter $x$, you would compute

## $$
## \bar x = \iint\! x f(x, y)\,\mathrm{d} x\,\mathrm{d} y
## $$

## which you can read simply as "the value of $x$ multiplied by the
## probability of parmeters $(x, y)$, integrated over all possible
## values that $x$ and $y$ could take.

### I'd like to use \{...\} here, but for HTML generation that is lost
### (we need to do \\{, \\}, but for PDF generation that won't work.
### So this way at least makes sense.

## An alternative way to compute this value is simulate $k$
## observations, $[(x,y)^{(1)}, \ldots, (x,y)^{(k)}]$, from $f(x,y)$
## and compute the sample mean as

## $$\bar x \approx \frac{1}{k} \sum_j x^{(j)}$$

## where $x^{(j)}$ is the the $x$ value from the $j$th sample.

## If these samples are independent samples from the distribution, then
## as $k \to \infty$ the estimated mean of $x$ will converge on the true
## mean.

## Suppose that our target distribution is a normal distribution with
## mean `m` and standard deviation `s`.  Obviously the mean of this
## distribution is `m`, but let's try to show that by drawing samples
## from the distribution.

## As an example, consider estimating the mean of a normal
## distribution with mean `m` and standard deviation `s` (here, I'm
## just going to use parameters corresponding to a standard normal):
m <- 0
s <- 1

## We can easily sample from this distribution using the `rnorm`
## function:
set.seed(1)
samples <- rnorm(10000, m, s)

## The mean of the samples is very close to the true mean (zero):
mean(samples)

## In fact, in this case, the expected variance of the estimate with
## $n$ samples is $1/n$, so we'd expect most values to lie within $\pm
## 2\, / \sqrt{n} = 0.02$ of the true mean for 10,000 points.
summary(replicate(1000, mean(rnorm(10000, m, s))))

## This function computes the cumulative mean (that is, for element
## $k$, the sum of elements $1, 2, \ldots, k$ divided by $k$).
cummean <- function(x)
    cumsum(x) / seq_along(x)

## Here is the convergence towards the true mean (red line at 0).

    lines(cummean(rnorm(10000, m, s)),
          col=rgb(runif(1), runif(1), runif(1), .5))

## How does this work?  Consider the integral

## $$
## \int_a^b h(x) \mathrm{d} x
## $$

## If this can be decomposed into the product of a function $f(x)$ and a
## probability density function $p(x)$, then

## $$
## \int_a^b h(x) \mathrm{d} x = \int_a^b f(x)p(x) \mathrm{d} x
## $$

## Note that the right hand side is simply the expectation $E[f(x)]$.
## By the Law of Large Numbers, the expected value is the limit of the
## sample mean as the sample size grows to infinity.  So we can
## approximate $E[f(x)]$ as

## $$
## \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i).
## $$

## You can do lots of similar things with this approach.  For example,
## if you want to draw a 95\% credibility interval around the estimate
## $\bar x$, you could estimate the bottom component of that by
## solving

## $$
## 0.025 = \int_{-\infty}^a\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\! x f(x, y)\,\mathrm{d} y\,\mathrm{d} x
## $$

## for $a$.  Or, you can just take the sample quantile from your
## series of sampled points.

## This is the analytically computed point where 2.5\% of the
## probability density is below:
p <- 0.025
a.true <- qnorm(p, m, s)
a.true

## We can estimate this by direct integration in this case (using the
## argument above)
f <- function(x) dnorm(x, m, s)
g <- function(a)
    integrate(f, -Inf, a)$value
a.int <- uniroot(function(x) g(x) - p, c(-10, 0))$root
a.int

## And estimate the point by Monte Carlo integration:
a.mc <- unname(quantile(samples, p))
a.mc

## Note that this has an error around it:
a.true - a.mc

## But in the limit as the sample size goes to infinity, this will
## converge.  Furthermore, it is possible to make statements about the
## nature of the error; if we repeat sampling process 100 times, we
## get a series of estimate that have error on around the same order
## of magnitide as the error around the mean:
a.mc <- replicate(100, quantile(rnorm(10000, m, s), p))
summary(a.true - a.mc)

## ## Still not convinced?

## This sort of thing is really common.  In most Bayesian inference
## you have a posterior distribution that is a function of some
## (potentially large) vector of parameters and you want to make
## inferences about a subset of these parameters.  In a heirarchical
## model, you might have a large number of random effect terms being
## fitted, but you mostly want to make inferences about one parameter.
## In a Bayesian framework you would compute the *marginal
## distribution* of your parameter of interest over all the other
## parameters (this is what we were trying to do above).  If you have
## 50 other parameters, this is a really hard integral!

## To see why this is hard, consider the region of parameter space
## that contains "interesting" parameter values: that is, parameter
## values that have probabilities that are appreciably greater than
## zero (these are the only regions that contribute meaningfully to
## the integrals that we're interested in, so if we spend our time
## doing a grid search and mostly hitting zeros then we'll be wasting
## time).

## For an illustration of the problem,

##   * consider a circle of radius $r$ within a square with sides of
##     length $2r$; the "interesting" region of space is $\pi r^2 / 4
##     r^2 = \pi / 4$, so we'd have a good chance that a randomly
##     selected point lies within the circle.
##   * For a sphere with radius $r$ in a *cube* with sides of length
##     $2r$, the volume of the sphere is $4/(3 \pi r^3)$ and the volume
##     of the cube is $(2d)^3$, so $4/3 \pi / 8 \approx 52\%$ of the
##     volume is "interesting"
##   * As the dimensionality of the problem, $d$, increases (using a
##     hypersphere in a hypercube) this ratio is
##     $$\frac{\pi^{d/2}}{d2^{d-1}\Gamma(d/2)}$$
d <- 2:10
plot(d, pi^(d/2) / (d * 2^(d-1) * gamma(d/2)), log="y", las=1,
     xlab="Dimension",
     ylab="Proportion of hypercube filled with hypersphere")

## So we don't need to add many dimensions to be primarily interested
## in a very small fraction of the potential space.  (It's also worth
## remembering that most integrals that converge must be zero almost
## everywhere or have a naturally very constrained domain.)

## As a less abstract idea, consider a multivariate normal
## distribution with zero covariance terms, a mean at the origin, and
## unit variances.  These have a distinct mode (maximum) at the
## origin, and the *ratio* of probabilities at a point and at the mode
## is

## $$\exp(-\sum_{i=1, d} x_i^2)$$

## The thing about this function is that *any* large value of $x_i$
## will cause the probability to be low.  So as the dimension of the
## problem increases, the interesting space gets very small.  Consider
## sampling within the region $-5 < x_i < 5$, and count how many of
## 10,000  sampled points have a relative probability greater than
## 1/1000
test <- function(d, x=5)
  exp(-sum(runif(d, -x, x)^2)) > 1/1000
f <- function(d, n)
  mean(replicate(n, test(d)))

d <- 1:10
data.frame(dimension=d, p.interesting=sapply(d, f, 10000))

## which drops off much like the hypersphere case.  Even by looking at
## only 4-5 dimensions we're likely to waste a lot of time if we tried
## to exhaustively integrate over parameter space.

## ## Why doesn't "normal statistics" use Monte Carlo methods?

## For many problems in traditionally taught statistics, rather than
## sampling from a distribution you **maximise or maximise a
## function**.  So we'd take some function that describes the
## likelihood and maximise it (maximum likelihood inference), or some
## function that computes the sum of squares and minimise it.

## The reasons for this difference are a little subtle, but boil down
## to whether or not you feel that you could possibly put a
## probability distribution over a parameter -- is it something you
## could sample?  Fisher in particular had strong thoughts on this,
## thoughts which are argued more recently by AWF Edwards in the book
## "Likelihood".  To avoid having to sample from a distribution (or
## really, to avoid the idea that one could draw samples from a
## probability distribution of parameters), error estimates in
## frequentist statistics tend to either be asymptotic large-data
## estimates or perhaps based on the bootstrap.

## However, the role played by Monte Carlo methods in Bayesian
## statistics is the same as the optimisation routine in frequentist
## statistics; it's simply the algorithm for doing the inference.  So
## once you know basically what MCMC is doing, you can treat it like a
## black box in the same way that most people treat their optimisation
## routines as a black box.

## # Markov Chain Monte Carlo

## At this point, suppose that there is some target distribution that
## we'd like to sample from, but that we cannot just draw independent
## samples from like we did before.  There is a solution for doing this
## using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).  First, we have to define
## some things so that the next sentence makes sense: *What we're going
## to do is try to construct a Markov chain that has our
## hard-to-sample-from target distribution as its stationary
## distribution*.

## ## Definitions

### Problem with rendering of the X_0s here...
## Let $X_t$ denote the value of some random variable at time $t$.  A
## Markov chain generates a series of samples $[X0, X1, X2, \ldots, Xt]$
## by starting at some point $X_0$, and then following a series
## of stochastic steps.

## Markov chains satisfy the *Markov property*.  The Markov property
## is the stochastic process version of "what happens in Vegas stays
## in Vegas"; basically it doesn't matter how you got to some state
## $x$, the probability of transition out of $x$ is unchanged, or:

## $$
## \Pr(X_{t+1} = x | X_t = x_t, X_{t-1} = x_{t-1}, \ldots, X_0 = x_0) = \Pr(X_{t+1} = x | X_t = x_t)
## $$

## The transition from one step to the next is described by the
## *transition kernel*, which can be described by the probability (or
## for continuous variables the probability *density*) of a transition
## from state $i$ to state $j$ as

## $$
## P(i \to j) = \Pr(X_{t+1} = j | X_t = i)
## $$

## Let $\pi_j(t) = \Pr(X_t = s_j)$ be the probability that the chain is in
## state $j$ at time (step) $t$, and define $\vec\pi(t)$ be the vector of
## probabilites over possible states.  Then, given $\vec\pi(t)$, we can
## compute $\vec\pi(t+1)$ using the *Chapman-Kolmogorov* equation.

## $$
## \pi_i(t+1) = \sum_k \pi_k(t) \Pr(k \to i)
## $$

## that is; the probability that we were in state $k$ multiplied by the
## probability of making the transition from $k$ to $i$, summed over all
## possible source states $k$.  Using the book-keeping of linear algebra,
## let $\mathbf{P}$ be the *probability transition matrix* -- the matrix
## whose $i,j$th element is $P(i \to j)$, and rewrite the above equation
## as

## $$\vec\pi(t + 1) = \vec\pi(t)\mathbf{P}$$

## Note that we can iterate this equation easily:

## $$
## \vec\pi(t+2) = \vec\pi(t+1)\mathbf{P}
## $$
## $$
## \vec\pi(t+2) = \vec\pi(t)\mathbf{P}\mathbf{P}
## $$
## $$
## \vec\pi(t+2) = \vec\pi(t)\mathbf{P}^2
## $$

## ## Stationary distributions

## If there is some vector $\vec\pi^*$ that satisfies

## $$\vec\pi^* = \vec\pi^*\mathbf{P}$$

## then $\vec\pi^*$ is the *stationary distribution* of this Markov
## chain.  Intuitively, think of this as the eventual characteristic
## set of states that the system will set in to; run for long enough
## that the system has "forgotten" its initial state, then the $i$th
## element of this vector is the probability that the system will be
## in state $i$.

## The Markov chain will have a stationary distribution if the process
## is *irreducible* (every state is visitable from every other state)
## and *aperiodic* (the number of steps between two visits of a state
## is not a fixed integer multiple number of steps).

## Mathematically, $\vec\pi^*$ is the left eigenvector assicated with
## the eigenvalue = 1.

## Here's a quick definition to make things more concrete (but note
## that this has nothing to do with MCMC itself -- this is *just* to
## think about Markov chains!).  Suppose that we have a three-state
## Markov process.  Let `P` be the transition probability matrix for
## the chain:
P <- rbind(c(.5,  .25, .25),
           c(.2,  .1,  .7),
           c(.25, .25, .5))
P

## note that the rows of `P` sum to one:
rowSums(P)

## This can be interpreted as saying that we must go *somewhere*, even
## if that place is the same place.  The entry `P[i,j]` gives the
## probability of moving from state `i` to state `j` (so this is the
## $P(i\to j)$ mentioned above.

## Note that unlike the rows, the columns do not necessarily sum to 1:
colSums(P)

## This function takes a state vector `x` (where `x[i]` is the
## probability of being in state `i`) and iterates it by multiplying
## by the transition matrix `P`, advancing the system for `n` steps.
iterate.P <- function(x, P, n) {
    res <- matrix(NA, n+1, length(x))
    res[1,] <- x
    for (i in seq_len(n))
        res[i+1,] <- x <- x %*% P
    res
}

## Starting with the system in state 1 (so `x` is the vector $[1,0,0]$
## indicating that there is a 100\% probability of being in state 1
## and no chance of being in any other state), and iterating for 10
## steps:
n <- 10
y1 <- iterate.P(c(1, 0, 0), P, n)

## Similarly, for the other two possible starting states:
y2 <- iterate.P(c(0, 1, 0), P, n)
y3 <- iterate.P(c(0, 0, 1), P, n)

## This shows the convergence on the stationary distribution.
##+ fig.cap="Convergence of simple Markov chain to stationary distribution"
matplot(0:n, y1, type="l", lty=1, xlab="Step", ylab="y", las=1)
matlines(0:n, y2, lty=2)
matlines(0:n, y3, lty=3)

## which means that regardless of the starting distribution, there is
## a 32\% chance of the chain being in state 1 after about 10 or more
## iterations *regardless of where it started*.  So, knowing about the
## state of this chain at one point in time gives you information
## about where it is likely to be for only a few steps.

## We can use R's `eigen` function to extract the leading eigenvector
## for the syste (the `t()` here transposes the matrix so that we get
## the *left* eigenvector).
v <- eigen(t(P), FALSE)$vectors[,1]
v <- v/sum(v) # normalise eigenvector

## Then add points to the figure from before showing how close we are
## to convergence:
##+ fig.cap="Convergence of simple Markov chain to stationary distribution"
matplot(0:n, y1, type="l", lty=1, xlab="Step", ylab="y", las=1)
matlines(0:n, y2, lty=2)
matlines(0:n, y3, lty=3)
points(rep(10, 3), v, col=1:3)

## Following the definition of eigenvectors, multiplying the
## eigenvector by the transition matrix returns the eigenvector
## itself:
drop(v %*% P) - v
## (strictly, this should be the eigenvalue multiplied by `v`, but the
## leading eigenvalue is always 1 for these matrices).

## The proceedure above iterated the overall probabilities of
## different states; not the actual transitions through the system.
## So, let's iterate the system, rather than the probability vector.
## The function `run` here takes a state (this time, just an integer
## indicating which of the states $1, 2, 3$ the system is in), the
## same transition matrix as above, and a number of steps to run.
## Each step, it looks at the possible places that it could transition
## to and chooses 1 (this uses R's `sample` function).
run <- function(i, P, n) {
    res <- integer(n)
    for (t in seq_len(n))
        res[[t]] <- i <- sample(nrow(P), 1, pr=P[i,])
    res
}

## Here's the chain running around for 100 steps:
##+ fig.cap="First 100 steps of the Markov chain"
samples <- run(1, P, 100)
plot(samples, type="s", xlab="Step", ylab="State", las=1)

## Rather than plotting state, plot the fraction of time that we were
## in each state over time:
##+ fig.cap="Probability of being in each state over first 100 steps"
plot(cummean(samples == 1), type="l", ylim=c(0, 1),
     xlab="Step", ylab="y", las=1)

lines(cummean(samples == 3), col=3)

## Run this out a little longer (5,000 steps)
##+ fig.cap="Probability of being in each state over first 5,000 steps"
n <- 5000
set.seed(1)
samples <- run(1, P, n)

     xlab="Step", ylab="y", las=1)
lines(cummean(samples == 2), col=2)
lines(cummean(samples == 3), col=3)
abline(h=v, lty=2, col=1:3)

## A sufficient (but not necessary) condition for the existance of a
## stationary distribution is Detailed Balance, which says:

## $$P(j \to k) \pi_j^* = P(k \to j) \pi_k^*$$

## This imples that the chain is *reversible*.  The reason why this
## condition implies that a stationary distribution exists is that it
## implies

## $$\vec\pi^* = \vec\pi^*\mathbf{P}$$

## Summing both sides of the detailed balance equation over states $j$

## $$\sum_j P(j \to k) \pi_j^* = \sum_j P(k \to j) \pi_k^*$$

## The term on the left is equal to the $k$th element of
## $\vec\pi^*\mathbf{P}$ and the term on the right can be factored:

## $$\sum_j P(k \to j) \pi_k^* = \pi_k^* \sum_j P(k \to j)$$

## Then, because $\sum_j P(k \to j) = 1$ (because $P$ is a transition
## probability function, by the law of total probability things go
## *somewhere* with probability 1), so the right hand side is $\pi_k^*$,
## so we have 

## $$(\vec\pi^*\mathbf{P})_k = \pi_k^*$$

## which holds for all $k$ so

## $$\vec\pi^*\mathbf{P} = \vec\pi^*$$

## So the key point here is: Markov chains are neat and well
## understood things, with some nice properties.  Markov chains have
## stationary distributions, and if we run them for long enough we can
## just look at the where the chain is spending its time and get a
## reasonable estimate of that stationary distribution.

## ## The Metropolis algorithm

## This is the simplest MCMC algorithm.  This section is not intended
## to show how to design efficient MCMC samplers, but just to see that
## they do in fact work.  What we're going to do is have some
## distribution that we want to sample from, and we're going to be
## able to evaluate some function $f(x)$ that is *proportional* to the
## probability density of the target distribution (that is, if $p(x)$
## is the probability density function itself, $f(x) \propto p(x)$,
## i.e., $f(x) = p(x) / Z$, where $Z = \int f(x) \mathrm{d} x$).  Note
## that $x$ might be a vector or a scalar.

## We also need a probability density function $P$ that we *can* draw
## samples from.  For the simplest algorithm, this **proposal**
## distribution is symmetric, that is $P(x\to x^\prime) = P(x^\prime \to
## x)$.

## The algorithm proceeds as follows.

## 1. Start in some state $x_t$.
## 2. Propose a new state $x^\prime$
## 3. Compute the "acceptance probability"
## $$\alpha = \min\left[1, \frac{f(x^\prime)}{f(x)}\right]$$
## 4. Draw some uniformly distributed random number $u$ from $[0,1]$; if
## $u < \alpha$ accept the point, setting $x_{t+1} = x^\prime$.
## Otherwise reject it and set $x_{t+1} = x_t$.

## Note that in step 3 above, the unknown normalising constant drops out
## because

## $$\frac{p(x^\prime)}{p(x)} = \frac{f(x^\prime)}{Z} \frac{Z}{f(x)} =
## \frac{f(x^\prime)}{f(x)}$$

## This will generate a series of samples $\{x_0, x_1, \ldots\}$.  Note
## that where the proposed sample is rejected, the same *value* will be
## present in consecutive samples.

## Note also that these are not independent samples from the target
## distribution; they are *dependent samples*; that is, sample $x_t$
## depends on $x_{t-1}$ and so on.  However, because the chain
## approaches a stationary distribution, this dependence will not
## matter so long as we sample enough points.

## ## MCMC sampling in 1d (single parameter) problems

## Here is a target distribution to sample from.  It's the weighted sum
## of two normal distributions.  This sort of distribution is fairly
## straightforward to sample from, but let's draw samples with MCMC.  The
## probability density function is

## $$
## f(x) = \frac{1}{z}
## p \frac{\exp(x - \mu_1)^2}{2 \sigma_1^2} +
## (1-p) \frac{\exp(x - \mu_2)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2}
## $$

## This is a contrived example, but distributions like this are not
## totally impossible, and might arise when sampling things from a
## mixture (such as human heights, which are bimodal due to sexual
## dimorphism).

## Fairly arbitrarily, here are some parameters and the definition of
## the target density.
p <- 0.4
mu <- c(-1, 2)
sd <- c(.5, 2)
f <- function(x)
    p     * dnorm(x, mu[1], sd[1]) +
    (1-p) * dnorm(x, mu[2], sd[2])

## Here is the probability density plotted over the "important" part
## of the domain (in general, this may not even be known!)
curve(f(x), col="red", -4, 8, n=301, las=1)

## Let's define a really simple minded proposal algorithm that samples
## from a normal distribution centred on the current point with a
## standard deviation of 4
q <- function(x) rnorm(1, x, 4)

## This implements the core algorithm, as described above:
step <- function(x, f, q) {
    ## Pick new point
    xp <- q(x)
    ## Acceptance probability:
    alpha <- min(1, f(xp) / f(x))
    ## Accept new point with probability alpha:
    if (runif(1) < alpha)
        x <- xp
    ## Returning the point:
    x
}

## And this just takes care of running the MCMC for a number of steps.
## It will start at point `x` return a matrix with `nsteps` rows and
## the same number of columns as `x` has elements.  If run on scalar
## `x` it will return a vector.
run <- function(x, f, q, nsteps) {
    res <- matrix(NA, nsteps, length(x))
    for (i in seq_len(nsteps))
        res[i,] <- x <- step(x, f, q)
    drop(res)
}

## We pick a place to start (how about -10, just to pick a really poor
## point)
res <- run(-10, f, q, 1000)
                
## Here are the first 1000 steps of the Markov chain, with the target
## density on the right:

## The original (grey line) trace is bouncing around quite freely.

## In contrast, the red trace (large proposal moves) is suggesting
## terrible spaces in probability space and rejecting most of them.
## This means it tends to stay put for along time at once space.

## The blue trace proposes small moves that tend to be accepted, but
## it moves following a random walk for most of the trajectory.  It
## takes hundreds of iterations to even reach the bulk of the
## probability density.

## You can see the effect of different proposal steps in the
## autocorrelation among subsequent parameters -- these plots show the
## decay in autocorrelation coefficient between steps of different
## lags, with the blue lines indicating statistical independence.

## The chains both "mix" worse than that first one.

## # MCMC In two dimensions

## This is a function that makes a multivariate normal density given a
## vector of means (centre of the distribution) and
## variance-covariance matrix.
make.mvn <- function(mean, vcv) {
  logdet <- as.numeric(determinant(vcv, TRUE)$modulus)

  vcv.i <- solve(vcv)

  function(x) {
    dx <- x - mean
    exp(-(tmp + rowSums((dx %*% vcv.i) * dx))/2)
  }
}

## As above, define the target density to be the sum of two mvns (this
## time unweighted):
mu1 <- c(-1, 1)
mu2 <- c(2, -2)
vcv1 <- matrix(c(1, .25, .25, 1.5), 2, 2)
vcv2 <- matrix(c(2, -.5, -.5, 2), 2, 2)

f2 <- make.mvn(mu2, vcv2)
f <- function(x)
    f1(x) + f2(x)

x <- seq(-5, 6, length=71)
y <- seq(-7, 6, length=61)
xy <- expand.grid(x=x, y=y)
z <- matrix(apply(as.matrix(xy), 1, f), length(x), length(y))

## Sampling from multivariate normals is also fairly straightforward,
## but we'll draw samples from this using MCMC.

## There are a bunch of different strategies here -- we could propose
## moves in both dimensions simultaneously, or we could sample along
## each axis independently.  Both strategies will work, though they
## will again differ in how rapidly they mix.

## Assume that we don't actually know how to sample from a mvn (it's
## not actually hard, but this is simpler), let's make a proposal
## distribution that is uniform in two dimensions, sampling from the
## square with width 'd' on each side.
q <- function(x, d=8)
    x + runif(length(x), -d/2, d/2)

x0 <- c(-4, -4)
set.seed(1)
samples <- run(x0, f, q, 1000)

image(x, y, z, xlim=range(x, samples[,1]), ylim=range(x, samples[,2]))
contour(x, y, z, add=TRUE)
lines(samples[,1], samples[,2], col="#00000088")

## Drawing a ton of samples"
set.seed(1)
samples <- run(x0, f, q, 100000)

## Compare the sampled distribution against the known distribution:
smoothScatter(samples)
contour(x, y, z, add=TRUE)

### library(hexbin)
### hbin <- hexbin(samples[,1], samples[,2], xbins = 40)
### plot(hbin, legend=FALSE)
### contour(x, y, z, add=TRUE)

## Then we can easily do things with the samples that are difficult to
## do directly.  For example, what is the *marginal distribution* of
## parameter 1:
hist(samples[,1], freq=FALSE, main="", xlab="x",
     ylab="Probability density")

## (this is the distribution that the first paramter takes, averaged
## over all the possible values that the second parameter might take,
## weighted by their probability).

## Computing this properly is tricky - we need to integrate over all
## possible values of the second parameter for each value of the
## first.  Then, because the target function is not itself normalised,
## we have to divide that through by the value of integrating over the
## first dimension (this is the total area under the distribution).
